A/B tests - apply a treatment to a group of subjects and ideally those subjects were randomly selected for treatment

control group ensures that "all things are equal" except for the desired treatment

one way hypothesis test: only care about one tail result (B > A, but dont care about A > B)
two way hypothesis test: B is different from A in either direction

two way can be a more conservative estimate to help avoid argument and is usually the default

resample: repeatedly sample values from observed data, with a general goal of assessing random variability in a statistic.
          Also used to assess and improve accuracy of some machine learning models (bagging).

two main types of resample:
    - bootstrap: bootstrap used to assess reliability of an estimate (see previous notes)
    - permutation: combining two or more samples together and randomly reallocating the observations to resamples.

permutation test steps:
    - combine results from the different groups of data into a single set
    - shuffle the combined data and randomly draw two new samples (without replacement)
    - calc test statistic
    - repeat N times until you've created a permutation distribution
    - compare the observed test stats to this distribution, if its outside the distribution then we've proved some effect

two other permutation variants:
    - exhaustive permutation test: ID all the ways to shuffle and combine data and create those samples
    - bootstrap permutation test: make draws with replacement, mimics random assignment to treatment/ control
                                  but also random assignment of selection from population

don't need normal distribution assumptions for this test

p-value the probability of seeing a value as extreme or more extreme given the null hypothesis is true.
    - low p-value, reject the null in favor of alternative

Type 1 error:
    - mistakenly conclude an effect is real, when it is really just due to chance
Type 2 error:
    - mistakenly conclude an effect is not real, when it actually is real

hypothesis tests are typically structured to reduce type 1 errors. Type 2 errors could be handled by larger sample sizes

alpha inflation:
    - multiple testing phenomenon, in which alpha, the prob of making a Type 1 error, increases as you conduct more tests.

Degrees of freedom: the number of values that are free to vary
    - once you know N - 1 values you can calculate the last (so it is not free to vary).
    - reduces bias when using an estimate of a population

ANOVA: test for a statistically significant difference among groups instead of only two groups
    - test looks at if all groups have the same underlying values and the differences are due to random chance

F test: statistical significance of group means aka ANOVA!

Chi square Test:
    - Used for count data and tests how well it fits some expected distribution

Fischer's Exact Test: calculates all possible resampling permutations for a chi2 test so you know the correct pvalue,
                        not an approximation

Multi-arm Bandit: Faster insight than traditional A/B testing.
    - testing multiple treatments at once and reach conclusions faster

sample size and test power: effect difference we want to measure plays a big part in these estimates.
