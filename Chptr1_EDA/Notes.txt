Two main types of data (with sub types):
    Numeric
        - Continuous: data which can take any value on an interval
        - Discrete: data which can only take interval values
    Categorical
        - Binary: special categorical which can only be two possible values
        - Ordinal: data which expresses ordering

Rectangular data: two dimensional matrix with rows indicating records and columns indicating features.

Trimmed mean: mean after trimming a set number of values on both tails.
    - estimates the influence of outliers

MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) * 1.4826 puts the value on the same scale as a Standard deviation.
