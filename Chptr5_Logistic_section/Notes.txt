Logistic regression is a popular method because of its fast computation speed
    and the output lends itself to rapid scoring of the data.

Logit: The function that maps class membership probability to a range from plus minus infinity (instead of 0 to 1).

Odds: Ratio of "success" to "not success"

Log odds: The response in the transformed model (now linear), which gets mapped back to the probability.

Binary outcomes should use a logistic regression INSTEAD of linear!

GLMs are characterized by two main components:
    1) probability distribution or family (binomial for logistic)
    2) link function: a transformation function that maps the response to the predictors (logit for logistic)

Logistic regressions differ from linear models in two main ways:
    1) the way the model is fit (least squares is not applicable)
    2) the nature and analysis of the residuals from the model

Logistic models are fit using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
    - the model most likely to produce the data we see
