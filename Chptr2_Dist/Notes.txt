- Coin flip event always follows a binomial distribution

random sampling: each member of the population has the same chance of being selected for the sample.
sample bias: sample is different in some meaningful and nonrandom way from the larger population.

stratified samples: split up population into strata then randomly sample from those.

Holdout sets can help deal with vast search effect
    - repeated modeling on a dataset until finding something interesting, could be by chance

Bootstrapping does not rely on CLT or assumptions about distributions

bootstrap - draw additional samples, with replacement, from the sample itself
            and recalculate the statistic or model for each resample.

baggging == bootstrap aggregating
