- Coin flip event always follows a binomial distribution

random sampling: each member of the population has the same chance of being selected for the sample.
sample bias: sample is different in some meaningful and nonrandom way from the larger population.

stratified samples: split up population into strata then randomly sample from those.

Holdout sets can help deal with vast search effect
    - repeated modeling on a dataset until finding something interesting, could be by chance

Bootstrapping does not rely on CLT or assumptions about distributions

bootstrap - draw additional samples, with replacement, from the sample itself
            and recalculate the statistic or model for each resample.

baggging == bootstrap aggregating

Normal distribution:
    - raw data typicall isnt normal, but errors are as are averages and totals in large samples

sample statistics (sample mean for example) usually follow a t-distribution

chi-squared statistic - measures the extent to which results depart from the null expectation of independence
    - goodness of fit; how well a set of values "fits" a specific distribution

f-distribution - differences in group means (ANOVA uses f-distrbution)

poisson distribution - events per unit of time or space when many such units exist

exponential distributions - models time between events occurring

weibull distribution - models time between events BUT does not assume the event rate is constant
